08/07/18 Reconfigured to use resource dictionary and fixed window control highlight (close,minimize,maximize)
```
```
05/05/19 Added some examples: - setting Mahapps icon as mdi icon
                              - Activated/Deactivated from CastagnaIT repo (nice idea)
                              - Closing cancel event for mdi child (works in my projects, fails in the Example...)
```
### Todos

 - [x] Fix close event for MDIChild
